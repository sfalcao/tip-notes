+ when sudo apt remove --purge tip-notes or sudo apt purge tip-notes,
  configuration folder is being kept.

  I guess the problem is due to accessing root /home instead of user /home

  Probably easy to fix

+ tip.bash autocomplete when called in form of tip [TAB] [TAB], list notes
  correctly but fails in autocomplete them, when calledin form
  tip -e [TAB] [TAB] it works correctly
