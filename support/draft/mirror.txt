tip-notes feature roadmap
=========================


mirror feature
------------

the idea is to provide a simple and effective way to keep a copy of user notes
and/or configurations so that if necessary last state of notes and/or
configuration files can be recovered. Syncing tends to be a better approach
than gzip backup if number of notes increases  too much. It is also more
efficient in terms of used space since duplicated files are avoid when
possible and safe

Basically a mirror of last state of config folder and/or notes folder is
created/synced. In addition, some extra folders are created to keep files
change history and copies of deleted files in order to increase safety

  | +-- notes-mirror
  | +-- deleted-notes
  | +-- notes-history

  + config
    |
    +-- config-mirror
    +-- config-history


usage:
--mirror [scope] [options]

--mirror		backup according to tiprc

scope:
--mirror --all		backup notes and configurations
--mirror --notes	backup notes only overriding tiprc
--mirror --config	backup config only overriding tiprc

options:
--do-not-keep-deleted-notes
   Notice that result in notes-mirror folder content is not affected, the only
   practical change is that deleted notes are not copied to deleted-notes
   folder before removed from notes-mirror folder!

   JUST USE THIS IF YOU NEED AND KNOW WHAT AND WHY YOU ARE DOING
   
--do-not-keep-changes-history
   Notice that result in notes-mirror and config-mirror folder content is not
   affected, the only practical effect is that changed files are not
   timestamped nor copied to respective history container

   JUST USE THIS IF YOU NEED AND KNOW WHAT AND WHY YOU ARE DOING
